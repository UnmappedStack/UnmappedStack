Kernel development is fun. Machine learning is interesting. Search engines are interesting too. Anything can be interesting if you're interested in it :P

I don't care which language I'm using, as long as it's C. Previously used Vim, switched to VSCode with Vim shortcuts.

UNIX is nice, but not perfect. `spawn()` > `exec()`/`fork()`, and a lettered VFS is simply the clearest.

Page rank is very cool. Too bad Google barely uses it anymore. I guess advertising is more important?

I keep forgetting to map the stack. Long live the kernel!
